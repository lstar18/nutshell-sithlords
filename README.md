# Nutshell-Sithlords
## Description
This project allows the owners of a company that run Renaissance Faires across the country to see the status of their faires.  They are able to see what food products, souvenirs, staff and shows are available at each fair.  They are able to add, edit and delete information to the page when they are logged in.
